# Hi, I'm Rafael Valoto 👋

I am a developer focused on software architecture, game development, and complex solutions.

## 🚀 My Journey & Work

I began studying **C++** to make a career transition, coming from a strong background in high-level languages like **JavaScript** and **PHP**. The repositories you see here are the direct result of what I've learned and built over the past year.

When I first dove into game development, my biggest initial barrier was handling input from Sony/PlayStation controllers across different game engines. Overcoming this challenge required a deep dive into hardware-level communication. The results of this exploration are repositories like **Unreal-Dualsense**, **Gamepad-Core**, **Pico_W-Dualsense**, and various integration prototypes for other engines on the market.

**The Next Step: Machine Learning**
Currently, I am developing a new library to make animation creation easier through machine learning. Since I had already been studying procedural animations and rigging, I decided to create this library to delegate the task of simplifying procedural animations to machine learning models. You can see the result of this work in the **Neura-Rig** repository.

## 🧠 Featured Projects

* **[Neura-Rig](https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/Neura-Rig):** An AI-driven procedural animation library combining Unreal Engine's Control Rig with PyTorch's C++ library (LibTorch).
* **[Unreal-Dualsense](https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/Unreal-Dualsense):** An open-source Unreal Engine plugin with an **NDA-Safe Architecture** (*policy-based design*) for seamless, compliant integration with proprietary SDKs.
* **[Gamepad-Core](https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/Gamepad-Core):** A game engine-agnostic library for DualSense and DualShock integration on any platform with C++ support. It serves as the structural foundation for advanced gamepad communication and management.
* **[Pico_W-Dualsense](https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/Pico_W-Dualsense):** Hardware-level integration exploring gamepad communication and input handling.

## ⚡ Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, tweaking Unreal integrations, or solving small compilation bottlenecks:
* 🛹 I'm skateboarding.
* 🥁 Listening to the classic sound of Minus the Bear (with a special shoutout to [Erin Tate's drum lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Tate)).
